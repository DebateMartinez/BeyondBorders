,YMD,: Okay. First question: how old are you and what do you do for work?,
,INT,: I am 30 years old and I work for an insurance agency here locally in my town.,work
,YMD,: Okay. So tell me a little bit about your origin. Where were you born? Where did you grow up?,
,INT,: So I was born in a very small town in Mexico. I was there from birth to about age three.,
,YMD,": From those ages, do you know a little bit about what the decision was to move to the United States from your parents or anything that you've heard? Any reasons?",dre
,INT,": I think my parents both wanted to give me a better life. I think they realized that in Mexico, I mean, Mexico's a lot different than being here in the US. Like there's definitely opportunities, but I don't think that they were the opportunities that my parents wanted for me. So I think that was the main reason for them to make the big decision of moving to a new country. But I guess at the same time, giving themselves an opportunity for work and a better lifestyle.",dre
,YMD,: Tell us a little bit about how you've navigated the legal process of your immigration status. How would you describe your experience living as an immigrant here in the United States?,law;bel
,INT,": Well, I think for the most part, growing up, I didn't really know what was going on. I think I was just kind of living life and just kind of trying to adapt basically to a new life, right? New country. When I got here, I had to learn English. I was one of only two students in my school who spoke only Spanish. So that was definitely tough. But growing up the whole legal status and things like that never really impacted me. I think it started impacting me more during going into eighth grade and then going into high school just because schools would offer trips to Europe or like, oh, we're taking a class trip to this country or that country. So I would always ask my mom and dad, ""Hey, this really interests me. Is this something that we might be able to do?"" They would always tell me something like, ""oh, we can't right now.""",bel;real
,INT,": So I always thought maybe it was a financial thing or just maybe because my parents didn't want to let me go on these trips until I was a freshman in high school. I wanted to get a permit and I wanted to learn to drive, get a license just like all my other friends. But that's when they explained to me my situation. So that's when I became aware of it. And I mean, it really wasn't a big deal because a majority of my friends were in the same boat, so I didn't feel left out or anything.",law;bel
,YMD,": Do you recall, looking back, you might have not realized it when you were little, but did you experience any negative experiences as a kid because of it, or did anyone say any negative comments?",stere
,INT,": No one really said any negative comments, just because the people that knew were my close friends and they were in the same boat. And I think at the same time, people like me were scared to say anything because what if they're going to be like, ""Hey, that guy is illegal or he is undocumented."" But I mean, I never really experienced anything like that. Like I said, just for me, the only experience was just missing out on certain things going into high school and missing those trips.",bel;real
,YMD,: Do you feel like you felt more comfortable sharing your immigration experiences with people who related to you? Did you find it difficult to explain it to someone who didn't have necessarily the same experience?,bel;comf
,INT,": Yeah, definitely. I felt a lot comfortable, a lot more comfortable explaining it to the people that I knew were not documented like me. It never crossed my mind to talk about it with other people at all. And I know during high school and stuff, you get to meet people, whether it's friends, girlfriends, whatever, and maybe on occasion the conversation will come up like, ""oh yeah, my parents and I went to Mexico for the summer"" and then they would ask me,""Oh, do you and your family go?"" And it was just a matter of brushing off the question or just saying like, ""oh yeah, we go on occasion"". Kind of lie. ",bel;comf
,INT,": But yeah, definitely didn't find it difficult for people that I related to, but there was definitely a little bit more difficulty explaining it to people who weren't aware of the situation at all. ",bel;comf
,YMD,: And so you said before that it was difficult to come into the United States being one of the only Mexican or Hispanic people in your school speaking only Spanish. Do you remember anything that made you have difficulties learning English or were there good systems in place for you to learn English?,diff;bel
,INT,": So yeah, so the school that my parents put me into, they really emphasized on the whole English and Spanish programs that they had. So like I mentioned, I think I was one, two or maybe three other kids that, again, spoke no English at all. So mornings would be all English learning with everyone else, and then after lunch we would get pulled aside into a different classroom with a teacher who spoke Spanish to kind of help us make that transition. So I mean, I think that's what helped me out a lot. And then I know at first it was difficult. I had no idea what I was saying. I don't know what other people were saying to me, but I think I started to pick up more and more. I still remember I said my first English phrase to my teacher, and she was like, ""oh my God, you're speaking English!"" So for me, that's a memory that still sticks to me. Just it shows I guess the hard work that I had to put in. ",diff;bel
,YMD,: Can you talk about a little bit about the legal processes. What happened after you found out that you were a illegal citizen? Did you get in contact with lawyers? Tell us a little bit about your journey.,law
,INT,": So after I found out or my whole situation, I kind of just let it be. I mean, I didn't let that stop me from enjoying high school. It wasn't until after I graduated when I was 18 that there was talks with my parents about them saying, ""Hey, maybe after college we're going to go back just because I don't think you're ever going to build something here unless you were to marry an american or if something within the laws were to change""  But I remember in 2013 is when they announced the DACA program here in the US. If you don't know what DACA is, it's pretty much they gave working permits, work permits, and a Social Security Number to people that were brought here. I believe it was before the age of 15. So I was obviously a candidate for it. I remember as soon as that came out, that's when me and my family started contacting lawyers, trying to see what the process is, what kind of documentation we need to provide, things like that.",law;pos
,,": So we pulled together everything, we did all the work that we needed to do, and thankfully I was able to get approved for that program. So when I was 23, I was on DACA and then just renewing it every two years again at the same time. It was nice. You had some sort of status. I was able to get a driver's license, I was able to build credit, I was able to work. Obviously, I couldn't leave the country  so I wasn't planning on going and visiting family that I haven't seen in forever. But after those years of DACA, I finally married the person [US Citizen] that I was with during high school, and then through those means I was able to fully go through another process to be able to get my green card.",law;pos
,,": So again, similar, just a bunch of documentation, paperwork, paperwork, lawyers, things like that. Eventually everything went well. You had to go through different interviews in order to get it. So I remember me and her had to go to the same office. They had to interview us both making sure it wasn't a fake thing, like a fake marriage. So once we did that, they approved me within a month on my green card, and I think that's when I finally felt, yeah, I felt comfort because knowing from here, I can only go up. I mean since then I've had a green card. I was able to travel. I was able to go and visit family in Mexico last year for the first time in 27 years. It was very nice to see family, and I'm happy to say that now I am a couple weeks away from going to my oath ceremony for citizenship. It's been a rollercoaster.",law;pos
,YMD,: Did you ever feel like there was more of an emotional toll or mental toll with all the interviews and processes you had to go through?,law;real
,INT,": Not for me. I think it was more just stress, just making sure that you have all the right paperwork, making sure that I make this appointment, or keeping track of specific interviews or whatever they send you to. I think it was more of the stress. I think I just felt a little nervous going into my citizenship interview just because they have to test you on history stuff. And so a lot of those topics I haven't even touched since middle school or high school.",law
,YMD,: Is that something that stood out to you most?  ,pos;law
,INT,": Well, it is fascinating to me because for me, it's easy. I go in there, they ask you to read a sentence out loud, and then they ask you, and then they'll read a sentence to you and you have to write it out. And then all the questions are in English, but to me English now is nothing. But like I said, it's fascinating to me because being at the offices, I saw a lot of other people from different ethnicities waiting to be interviewed, and their English is not as good as mine. You can still hear the accent in them. Some people I can still see they had interpreters. So I mean, it's really fascinating to see that those people can manage to still do it. So I think that's what was surprising, that there's a lot of people that know a little bit of English and they can grasp the language a little bit, and yet they're still able to go through the process and be able to become citizens. There's so many barriers to it that many people don't realize.",law;real
,YMD,: Okay. So you talked a little bit about how you recently went to Mexico just in this past year. I kind of wanted to touch on how you incorporate your culture in your daily life in the US. Do you think there's more a specific part in your life where you realize that that incorporating my Mexican and American culture is difficul? Or what does your Mexican culture look like here in America for you?,bel;diff
,INT,": Yeah. I mean, I will say after being in Mexico for two weeks, I mean the culture here is totally different. And even the type of Mexican or Latino culture that they try to introduce here in the US, it's nothing compared to what you see over there. So the two weeks that I was there, the small town where I'm from, they have an annual festival. And so everyone within the town or village, whatever you want to call it, they'll gather. They'll put up different posts for food, handmade, handmade stuff. They have a big carnival. So just witnessing that there. I've never seen anything like that here. And it's not even a 4th of July type of thing that they're doing. It's mainly just they're celebrating certain things about the town itself. So obviously being there, people over there are a lot nicer. You'll go into a restaurant and they'll be like, ""oh, hey, good afternoon.""",diff
,,": Or just the simplest things that you don't see here. And even here, you go to a Mexican restaurant, you walk in and you see a bunch of white families, they'll just stare at you. Sometimes. They'll just even give you an awkward stare. Whereas over there, you walk in anywhere and they treat you like you're a friend or a family member, like, ""Hey, good afternoon, how are you? Oh, how's it going? Hope your day's going well."" Things like that. I think that's one of the things that surprised me the most. It's just how different people are there. And then obviously the food.",diff
,INT,": The food does not compare here to what's over there. So I think after that trip, I really tried to value where I come from. And I'm not saying I'm ashamed of what this country has to offer too. At the end of the day, this is my home. I know I was born in Mexico, but at the end of the day, this has been my home. But I try to incorporate more of my heritage now just because I really value it. I try to speak more Spanish just to keep it perfect. I wouldn't say perfect, but just to make sure that I don't end up forgetting. Even though with my mom and dad, it's always Spanish. I try to teach my daughter. I try to speak to her in Spanish so she can go ahead and grasp it as well. ",diff;pos
,YMD,": I know you said that you moved here when you were three, so I'm not expecting you to know much or remember much, but do you think your parents' dreams of or encouragement of giving you a better life here than in Mexico has actualized? Do you think that's true? Do you think that America has more to offer? Do you think all their expectations are what you're experiencing?",real;diff
,INT,": I think so. And especially after being in Mexico, you see a lot of things that kind of just open your eyes, and I think they make you value your life here a lot more. I know one of the things out there that I saw is I was out on vacation and stuff, and then you go into a restaurant and then you see a family come in trying to sell handmade bracelets, candy or chips, the simplest things. And then you see their seven, eight year olds with them trying to sell with them. So I think just seeing that it's a little heartbreaking just because those families are trying to do everything to make sure that they can provide for their family. Whereas here, I mean, you don't see that often. You don't go into a restaurant and then you see a family trying to make money at whatever cost to be able to pay rent or pay food. So I think that definitely it helps you value, and I would say the experiences here is what my parents wanted for me, because in the US I was able to get an education. I did some college, but school wasn't for me. But I made my own career out of insurance and I'm loving it, and so now I'm inches away from becoming a citizen. So I think the expectations were fully blown out of the water.",real;diff
,YMD,": Yeah, that's good. Yeah. So do you have any other hopes and dreams for yourself and your immigration journey? Obviously you're coming to a close here, going to become a citizen, but do you have any other hopes and dreams of how you're going to use your now newfound citizenship to progress in life or help your daughter?",dre
,INT,": I think it's definitely a more calming thing, knowing that I will be here for my daughter no matter what. And then just a matter of being able to be more involved in certain things that I wasn't involved before, whether it's voting or whatever it may be, and hopefully being able to also help my parents gain citizenship, I mean, I'm pretty sure that can open the doors for them to be able to adjust their status as well and just be able to give them that peace of mind. But yeah, I mean, I'm excited. Really nothing more I can say it's just exciting and hopefully travel the world, get to know places that I've never been to and just enjoy life.",dre;pos
,YMD,": Apart from your own experience as an immigrant, have you heard any comments or stereotypes about immigrants who come to this country or any misconceptions that you've kind of heard? ",stere
,INT,": I mean, you tend to hear certain things, and if I'm being honest with you, I'm the kind of person that kind of deflects that kind of stuff. I don't really care what people think of me. If you want to say something about me, it's not going to affect me. I personally have never had anything said to me where involved a stereotype or anything like that. But I think every now and then you hear people say, ""oh, look at that guy. He's only with her because he wants to get papers"", like the old 'paper trick'. But you don't know people's lives, right? Yes, maybe he might be undocumented, but maybe he's wanting to make an honest living here in this country, and maybe he really loves that person. You never know. Or there's people that say ""oh, that guy, he's only having a family because he wants papers."" It's like, again, don't judge a book by its cover. You don't know what's going on in their lives. And I think that's the most common things that you'll hear. It seems normalized to a point, some might joke about it while they have never dealt with an illegal immigration status.",stere
,YMD,: Have you ever heard of stories from other people that you know?,
,INT,": I recently I reconnected with a friend from high school. He was actually one of the friends that was within my group that we knew all of our situations. He was in the process of applying for his residency, so getting a green card. His situation though, was a little bit more rocky. They told him that in order for him to adjust his status, he needed to go and apply outside of the US so he had to go back to Mexico and then do everything from the offices there. However, things got pretty complicated with his stuff to the point where he was in Mexico for three years. Away from his family, his life. I think sometimes that's what stops certain people from pursuing immigration status because they'll hear a horror story of like, ""oh, he had to leave the country, and then he was never able to come back in,"". And I feel like that discourages a lot of people. But I would say just do your own investigation, get a consultation and see what your case is, because not everyone's scenario is always going to be the same.",law;fea
,YMD,": Okay. Last question,  Is there any advice or knowledge you would like to give people who are going through a similar thing that you've gone through during this citizenship process, or even just thinking about moving to the us? Do you have any advice for them?",bel;adv
,INT,": I mean, obviously I would say for the people that want to move here, do it right? Don't put yourself in this situation, especially nowadays with everything that's going on in this country, coming here illegally is not the smartest way. It's easier said than done of course, but I can't say it's an easy journey. It would allow you to be able to work and live worry free. And then I would say for the people that are already here, I would say definitely keep yourself informed, keep yourself updated. I feel like laws are changing all the time. Procedures are changing all the time. Just don't give up hope and be the best person that you can be. If you can avoid trouble, trust me, one day you're going to say, ""I'm glad I didn't do that stupid thing, get arrested or get in trouble with the law,"" because that can harm you from getting legal status. I would say just keep on going. Continue to do what you're doing here and nothing is impossible. ",adv
