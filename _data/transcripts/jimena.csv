,YMD,": Okay, how old are you and what is your employment or school status?",
,INT,: I'm 18 years old and I'm currently in a high school.,
,YMD,: Any future plans?,
,INT,": Yeah, I'm planning on attending Boston College for my next four years from a bachelor's degree and majoring in philosophy/theology and on a pre-med track.",
,YMD,: So tell me a little bit about your origin. Where were you born and how did you grow up?,
,INT,: So I was born in Mexico City and I lived there only for a year. And then my family moved to Argentina for eight years and then from there we moved and immigrated to the United States.,
,YMD,: Tell us a little bit about your parents' decision or anything that you knew about moving to the us. When did it happen and for what reasons?,law
,INT,": Yeah, so my dad worked a lot and so that's the reason I was born in Mexico was because he needed to be there for a job for a year. And then the reason that we all moved to Argentina was because of my mom's entire family was there. And so we wanted to be near family, especially since I was very young and I had kind of the beginning of my childhood there, but eventually the economic system in Argentina started failing really badly and things just started getting really difficult. We didn't have stable living and it caused my dad a lot of stress, which eventually led to a lot of heart problems for him. So we were forced to leave and go somewhere more stable.",law;diff
,YMD,": How did you feel during that time? Obviously you were a kid going through that, but what did you think about the us? Did you have any preconceived ideas of it?",stere;real
,INT,": I was really young and I remember all I was thinking about the United States is how it's a ton of opportunity and a ton of different people, and it just seemed like a really great choice and it kind of felt like the only choice in that moment just because there was so much going on. Everyone was moving out, my dad was really sick, we just couldn't live there any longer. So it just felt like, I don't know, just the only solution to our problem in that moment. ",real
,YMD,: What is it describing your immigration experiences to others? Is it difficult or do you find comfort in sharing it with certain people?,comf
,INT,": Yeah, I definitely have a hard time sharing with everyone just because I feel like there's a preconceived notion that I don't know, there's stereotypes that come along with it and I just don't like to be classified into this idea of who I am based off of what people have been told, when they don't know my story and they don't know really why I even moved to the United States. So I usually do feel more comfortable speaking to people who have immigration stories and really understand that they come in all forms. It's not just one way that people immigrate to the United States.",comf;stere
,YMD,: Tell us a little bit about those stereotypes. What have you heard in your time of living here?,stere
,INT,": Yeah, I've heard a lot on both sides. So I've heard people kind of tell me, ""you must have immigrated illegally then and ""you just jumped to the border or something"". It is just like this stereotype that I'm like, ""you don't even know what my parents are. You don't know their legal status in the United States, and you're just going to assume that I'm illegal because I lived my first eight years outside of the United States."" And even then I've also had people put me in a lower position because they know my history. They're like, ""oh, well then it must be so hard for you in the United States"" and ""oh, you must not get opportunities other people do in the United States."" And I don't know, just they put you into this box that makes me think, ""why are you defining me as something that I don't identify with?"" And that's just harmful.",stere;bel
,YMD,: So how do you incorporate your culture into your daily life here in the US after hearing all of these comments?,bel;diff
,INT,": I feel like a big part of my culture and the Hispanic culture, that I've loved and made me really sad when I left, was the ""emotional connectivity"" is the way I would say it. It was a culture shock. Everyone in the United States is very individual, it's not a collective type of society. It just feels like everyone's on their own doing their own thing and very separate from the rest. That isn't at all what I had experienced in Argentina. And so what I've tried to do is anywhere I go and with anyone I'm with, I try to just bring a little bit of just of a connection just to be able to open up and be vulnerable with my emotions and be able to just be open with them and not kind of put up a wall, which is something I've felt a lot when I moved to the US. And I also have tried to expose people to my culture through basic things like food or through music. Things to maybe switch a stereotype, a story that they're assigning to me. I also do tell people my immigration story if they're curious. And I would love to communicate with people about my story just because it gives a different perspective.",bel;diff
,YMD,: How do you think you have gone through barriers from people's stereotypes or just culture in the us? How do you think you've navigated that through making friends? Do you think it's posed a challenge for you to make friends socially?,bel
,INT,": So when it comes to the stereotyping, okay, so I'm going to kind of separate these two because social and academic I feel are very different. So when it comes to those who have stereotyped me in an academic place, what I do is to just prove them wrong. I'm like, ""you know what? If you're going to put me in this box, I'm just going to prove to you that that's not real. That's not me."" I've had people tell me, ""well then you must not get opportunity. You must not do this, you can't do that."" And I'm like, ""all right, well watch me."" You know what I mean? I can do this stuff. It's not something that you can just tell me what I am and what I can and can't do, and I'm just going sit back and accept it.",bel;stere
,INT,": When it comes to the social aspect, I think it's something I'm still trying to grasp and gravel with. I feel like I just connect a lot more with people of just of my culture and my ethnicity, and it's just really difficult, especially going to a private school, which is small and it's not as diverse. It's just very difficult because it almost makes you feel like you have to assimilate to it. So I think with that, that's something I'm trying to work on, but I've started realizing that it honestly is beneficial to the people around me, even if they're not like me or have the same background as me, for me to just be authentic and unique and bring my culture and everything that comes along with it into any social situation because it just adds something that a lot of people don't often see. And I think that that's beautiful.",bel;stere
,YMD,: Do you remember your first impression of the US? Do your experiences now line up with any expectations you had before coming?,real
,INT,": Yeah, I actually remember when I first moved, I went to a public elementary school, and I remember I had a teacher named Ms. Orran, but I barely spoke any English, so I just called her Orange and she would get so mad at me and I just never understood. And it was just kind of this shock where I had this expectation that I was going to come to the United States and everyone was super nice and welcoming and very kind, and then she was the one who burst my bubble automatically.",stere;real
,INT,": And then on top of that, I had teacher after teacher meetings with my parents saying, ""she's not capable enough to be here. She can't do this, she can't be in this education because she literally doesn't know the language."" And so that was very shocking and kind of eyeopening for me. I thought people were going to be very open to helping me learn and grow and develop my skills, but instead it was kind of like a, if you fit in and if you don't, you're out. And so it kind of gave me this cutthroat idea of what the US looked like. And yeah, that changed my perspective.",stere;real
,YMD,": Do you have any concerns currently about immigration status or do you have any concerns just relating to that, even just in policies in the us?",law
,INT,": That's a great question. I'm going to be honest, I haven't stayed or kept myself updated with immigration policies recently. I used to be very involved in the news and what was going on, especially with immigration laws. But what I will say is my entire family, they're all immigrants. We all worked really, really hard to be in the United States, and even in the US we do work really hard and we do. We fight for the opportunities that we have. So for that, all I'll say is maybe less on the policy side and on the law side and just more on the humanitarian side, it's like people need to be accepted no matter where they're from and what their background is. I think obviously leaving your door open to absolutely anyone is, it is dangerous, but people with the right intentions and people who are here to do good and to grow and to better their lives and to be just good members of society, that's only going to be beneficial to the economy.",law;fea
,INT,": And I think it's only going to help us. So I guess just to that I'll say, I don't know. That's how I feel. That's just my perspective to it. And I feel like the process, here's what I will say about the process, it is very difficult. I saw my grandma go through it, I saw my aunt go through it, I saw my uncle and a ton of the members of my family go through it, and they had to wait years. My aunt had to marry someone in the US to get immigration or legal status in the us. It is those types of things where I'm like, ""these are good people and people that want to work and be just good members of society,"" and it doesn't make sense to me why there's certain rules and regulations that almost feel like just irrelevant. You know what I mean? Like unfair. You give me an immigration test and I probably won't be able to pass it. So I don't know, it's just things like that that make it a little bit difficult for me to stand by a lot of the immigration practices in the US.",law
,YMD,: Do you have any other hopes and dreams in the us? How will you use your US citizenship in relation to what you hope for yourself in the future?,
,INT,": Yeah, so I'm planning on pursuing a very extended education because I'm planning on going to medical school. And then what I really want to do is do Doctors without Borders. So it's actually funny that I want to travel the world just because the education I'm going to be receiving is in the United States, it's going to be amazing, especially the medical education. And I dunno, I think this is kind of going more towards the professional side of medicine. I feel like there's, in a capitalist economy, medicine has become more of a business and I am very much against that. And that's just not the code that I stand by. I want to help people and I want to heal people, and I don't care how much money I make for it. And so for me, I just really want to travel the world with the education that the United States will provide for me and just heal people.",real;work
,YMD,: This is my final question. So is there any advice or knowledge you would like to give people who are either going through the citizenship process and becoming a legal citizen or anyone who's even thinking of coming to the us? Do you have any advice for them?,adv
,INT,": I would say, this might sound cliche, but just don't stop fighting for [a place in the US]. Don't stop and don't quit. You will receive a citizenship if you have the right intentions and you're a good person and you might have to go through a moment of a lot of struggle and failure. But just keep going. I understand it. I saw it with my own family. How difficult it can be to be in distress and not knowing what your future holds. And it's just trust in the fact that you will receive citizenship. I don't even know. It's just so difficult because then I'm like, the laws are constantly changing. Honestly, just lean on the people around you too. Lean on your connections. And once you do enter the United States, don't let other people get to you. Don't let others' opinions affect you. And just really honestly, just prove people wrong. Just prove everyone and their preconceived notions wrong. And that's it. That's my biggest piece of advice. ",adv;pos
