,YMD,: How old are you and what do you do for work. ,
,INT,: I am 47 and I am a teacher at a private school in the west. ,
,YMD,": Yes. Ok, so tell me about your origin. Where were you born and where did you grow up?",
,INT,": I was born in Kingston, Jamaica and I was raised in St. Catherine, Jamaica.",
,YMD,: So tell us about your decision to move to the US. When did it happen and for what reasons?,
,INT,": So when i turned thirty years old, I needed a change. I was getting bored with the education system in Jamaica and I was like i need to see what the rest of the world has to offer. So i applied in this cultural exchange work program and I got it . I moved to to North Carolina and the cultural exchange program was just for five years but after you know being here living the US and seeing that it was it was better economically to be here than going back to Jamaica, I decided to start the immigration process to see if I would be successful in immigrating here to the US. So my journey started with my career and I just enjoyed what the US had to offer. ",law
,YMD,: How old were you when you first moved. ,law
,INT,: I was thirty.,law
,YMD,: So how would you describe living experiences here in the US compared to Jamaica?,law
,INT,: So economically I do better here and in the US things are affordable. You know Jamaica third country so economically it's better for me. Culturally and otherwise its for me in Jamaica you know family and friends and food and just a different feeling you know your so like less things like less discrimination. No one's really discriminating against you as a Jamaican when you're in Jamaica. It's a different vibe so basically I'm here for the opportunities its a better economical opportunity,law;diff
,YMD,: Do remember your first impression of the US? Did you have an expectation?,real
,INT,": Growing up in Jamaica we would visit the US for like short trips like for two weeks to New York to visit family or in Florida and so on . So moving to Carolina was a huge culture shock for me in terms of like how people relate to each other. Also how kids respect adults. Like in Jamaica it is taught to respect your adults especially older adults like you would never pass an adult on the Street and not say ""good morning"" and here you see kids not acknowledging older people it was strange to me. Another thing that was strange was the school system and getting used to that. Another thing I thought was that everyone in the US was rich. ",real;diff
,INT,: I thought everyone in America had money. So I came and i saw like a poverty and students that had the bare minimum of necesities. And at my school we had a program on Saturday's for kids to go to school so I would volunteer and help out. But it was a real shock to me. I thought everyone was finacially stable. ,real
,YMD,: So how do you feel telling others your immigration story? What is your comfort level?,comf
,INT,": I really feel comfortable sharing it. My comfort came from a conference I went to my first year teaching. I wasn't comfortable sharing it before because people say rude things like ""oh you only came here to take jobs away from people"" so it was difficult. At the conference, i joined the international Affinity group and ever since then I come back and return to the same conference and affinity group. The people in the affinity group are from different places in the world, different ethnicity, different races but we all have the same immigration story that puts us together. Like for example when I trying to relate to others I'm not looking at an African American like person. Im looking at someone from a different country like I'm looking for someone from england or from MÃ©xico or I'm looking for looking from Brazil. Like ""you are my person"" because we share this experience and its such a hard journey. So they were the ones who really empowered me and I felt comforted seeing these people who understood my journey and the struggle that comes with it.",comf
,YMD,: All right so could you describe a little bit about the process? What were the hardships you went through? Do you remember any positive experiences?,law
,INT,": Ok so like I said before, I came here as cultural Exchange visa. And the exchange visa requires you to maintain like good behavior, good everything so I was very cautious of that. I never drove over the speed limit. I never did anything that would jeopardize my stay here.  So after my visa time passed I was like ""Ok im gonna stay,"" so i went through this process of applying for a waiver so I could waive my 2 year home stay. Because when you have the visa I had, you had to go back home for two years and reapply. I didn't want to do that because I was already here. So then I tried to go find a job. There were so many sleepless nights. And I found so much dissapointment. There were so many schools who told me my  resume was perfect but they wouldn't offer me a job because I was an immigrant. And they wouldn't want to go through the trouble of filling all the paperwork to let me work there. I was getting used to so many ""No's"". But finally one school took a chance on me. They didn't mind that they needed to fill out all of my paperwork. They hired a laywer and everything. But of course something had to happen. My papers were rejected. And the lawyer told me that this only happens to less than one percent of people. So I had to do everything over again. There were no reason for it being rejected.",law
,YMD,: So what happened after?,law
,INT ,": It was November 8th, 2016 when I got approved. I was checking online and I was in tears. So then I got my green card. And you had to be on your green card for at least 4 years before applying for citizenship. And I waited until I could apply for my citizenship. But even the citizenship application was difficult. I became a citizen in January 2022. Even the exam is unfair. People who were born here even say they wouldn't be able to pass a citizenship test. While I was taking it, all I could think about is how difficult this test is for people who don't speak english. My friends that I met at the conference from africa or from mexico, italy, etc, told me how difficult it was since they weren't native english speakers. ",law;pos
,INT,": It's hard there's a lot of barriers that come with it. You have to study 100 questions and out of those 100, they pick 10 to ask you for the test. They can ask you any 10. ",law
,YMD,": Ok back to your culture, what kind of cultural aspects do you include in your everyday life? ",diff
,INT,": So in my daily life, I dont eat a lot in restaurants I mostly cook. So cooking jamaican food is a way I connect with my culture. I also maintain a strong connection to my family back in Jamaica. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't talk to them on multiple occasions. Anytime I hear about something related to Jamaica like events here in the US, I try to attend. I have friends also from the carribean and we sometimes have potlucks with our different cultural foods so that helps a lot also. ",diff
,YMD,: What aspects might not be as rich?,diff
,INT,": I think my language isn't as rich like even though English is Jamaica's native language, we were colonized by the British and so the pronunciations different. And so like in Jamaica we pronounce ""mandatory"" like ""man-day-tory"" and I've adjusted my pronunciation I guess. So when I go home and I'm speaking like they're looking at me like ""what?"" and I'm like ""oh my god, i'm losing my pronunciation"". I shop at this one store quite frequently and the manager she's from Haiti and a friend of hers from Haiti came to visit. And the manager introduced us like ""oh here's my carribean sister"" and I was like ""oh yes how are you?"" and she told me ""you do not sound Jamaican"". And it ruined my entire evening like I cannot lose my language. And also trying to fit in, I felt like I couldn't be as loud. Us Jamaicans, we laugh, we talk all loud and it feels like I'm not myself without that aspect and me having to tone it down. ",diff;bel
,YMD,: What comments have others made about your immigration status? ,stere
,INT,": Oh, I have been told ""go back to your country"". Um people have said ""you are here to take jobs"". I remember it was 2012 and I was trying to find a job as I've said. And people assume since you are from a different country, like this principal's wife came to pick me up, and she told me ""oh you've only been here for so and so years and you speak english so well!"" Like she just assumed I spoke no english before. There's so many condescending comments like ""you're so smart for only living here a couple years"" and I'm like ""do you not expect me to be smart?"" and its only because I have an accent. ",stere
,YMD,: Wow.,
,INT,: So people assume the same thing about immigrants. Everybody assumes that we all came here by some means that was illegal. People look at you like you're a criminal. Because you an immigrants. ,stere
,YMD,: Do you think some of these assumptions are enforced by the media?,stere
,INT,": I think a lot of it has been enforced by the media. I don't know if I should say this but by the former president. And I mean it ripped me into pieces because immigrants work so hard. Our stories are so great and we help to build a country like when I come here and I work, my taxes don't go to Jamaica. All my taxes stay right here. I am helping build this country as well you know and to look at immigrants has less than is very very hurtful for me. It still is. ",stere
,YMD,: What are your hopes and dreams for immigration in this country and hopes and dreams for yourself? ,dre
,INT,": So my hopes and dreams for immigration in this country are to just build a system that makes it make it more accessible for people to become citizens like you shouldnt have to be on a green card for four years before you can apply to be a citizen like you've here, you are contributing to the economy, you're doing what you're supposed to do. You know you're contributing to your community and so like why is it so hard. I think there just has to be a better pathway to become a citizen in this country. The other thing is that the borders are so heavily patrolled more than our own streets. Not everyone coming to the US is a criminal. I wish there were people helping with mental health or other professionals at the border aiding immigrants you know? All immigrants are hard workers. And most have so much trauma coming from different humanitarian crises, so it would help having people there to help instead of brute force. The country can really grow. ",dre
,YMD,: What are your hopes and dreams for yourself?,dre
,INT,": To inspire young people. And to let people know that immigrants are great. I want young students to look up at me now or years down the road and say ""hey she was an immigrant and she was an inspiration"" so that's all I want. To make a difference in others. ",dre
,YMD,: Is there any advice or knowledge you would like to give other's who are going through the immigration process?,adv
,INT,: Don't give up. There are so many people who have done it before you and you will not be the last. All the dissapointments that might come are only making you stronger. All the adversity to go through only builds you up as a stronger person. ,adv
